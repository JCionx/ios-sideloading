            Feather is an open-source app that allows you to sign and install apps on your iOS device.
            <br>
            To install Feather, you need to install a version of the app that is signed with a certificate. Sometimes the certificates won't work on your device, so I added 10 different versions of the app. This website will guide you through the entire process.
