                <span class="bold">What is sideloading?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Sideloading is the process of installing apps on your device without using the official app store. This allows you to install apps that are not available in the app store or to install modified versions of existing apps.

                <span class="bold">What iOS/iPadOS versions are supported?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Because enterprise certificates are a native and legit way to install apps, this method works on all iOS versions. However, the Feather app is only supported on iOS 15 and above.

        <div class="card">
            <p>
                <span class="bold">Do certificates expire?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                No. Even if the Feather app says that the certificate is expired, it will still work, because you are using the Anti-revoke DNS.

        <div class="card">
            <p>
                <span class="bold">How many apps can be sideloaded with a single certificate?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                As many as you want. The only limitation is the amount of storage on your device.

        <div class="card">
            <p>
                <span class="bold">Is this safe?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes. You can see the source-code of the Feather app on GitHub, as well as the source-code of my Anti-revoke DNS. You still need to be careful with what you decide to sideload, as some apps or mods may contain malware.

            <p>
                <span class="bold">What is the password of the certificate?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                The password of the certificate is inside the <span class="bold">password</span> file that you extracted.
